## PROJECT PROPOSAL

The primary objective of this project is to analyze the sales and revenue data of Walmart USA and present the findings in an intuitive and interactive manner. To accomplish this, I have utilized the capabilities of Power BI, a powerful business intelligence tool, to create an insightful dashboard that showcases key metrics and visualizes the data through various charts and graphs.

## KEY FEATURES
